Goat, Wolf and Cabbage
======================

Write a computer program that will be simulation the goat, wolf and cabbage puzzle.

Goat, wolf and cabbage want to cross the river. There is a boat with a ferryman that can take
one of them onboard. If wolf and goat end up on the same river bank without a ferryman, the
wolf will eat the goat. If the goat and cabbage stay on the same bank without a ferryman, the
goat will eat the cabbage. The initial state is wolf, goat, cabbage and a ferryman on one
side of the river.

Your program should ask the user who is going over to the other side. And who is going back.
It should print the state of the "game". If the user makes a mistake the game is over.
The user can quit the game at any time.

Provide a start menu with 3 options: 1) play the game, 2) rules, 3) quit the game
