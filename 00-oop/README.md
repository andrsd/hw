OOP (basics)
============

1. design a class hierarchy for geometrical objects like: circle, square, rectangle, triangle.
2. each object will have its own parameters like radius for circles, sides for rectangles, etc.
3. each object has to be able to:
   - compute its own surface,
   - compute its own circumference,
   - identify itself
4. create a small program that will put these objects into an array. we want multiple instances
   of each one, i.e. several circles of different sizes.
5. write a loop that will go over the array and will compute the total surface of all objects

Note: this is fairly dumb example, because we want to keep it simple, but it teaches an
important OO principle.

Extra credit: Do not use IDE, but write your own makefile to build the final executable.
